The second section will run through a quick example of using a package, `randomForest` for some analysis.  I've included this section just to show how (relatively) trivial it is to add an advanced capability to R via packages.

#Quick Links to Exercises and R code
- [Lesson 7 R Code](/gedr/rmd_posts/2015-01-14-07-Analyze.R): All the code from this post in an R Script.
- [Exercise 1](#exercise-1): Use random forests to predict NLA condition class. 

##Lesson Goals
- Understand how to add statistical functionality to R via packages

##Contributed Packages - Example with `randomForest`

Describe Random Forests

Great way to build robust predictive models that are not subject to the assumptions of classic statistics.  Tend to produce more reliable results.

#Exercise 1
1. Get Random Forest set up
2. Can we predict ref, so-so, and trash?
