Having now presented these materials to multiple groups of eager USEPA students, I wanted to add one last post to the site with some parting thoughts.  But before I do that, I wanted to, as promised, put up my code for each of the exercises.  There are many ways to succesfully complete the exercises so your code will very likely be different than what I have presented here.  That being said the answers should not be different (except randomForest).

##Parting Thoughts
- wont become profecient in a 2 day workshop
- Find a project to use it on
    - part of this is to force you to NOT use old tools

- Reproducibility

##Nuts and Bolts
The nuts and bolts of putting this site together is interesting, I think, in and of itself.  In case anyone is interested in this, I provide some of those details here.
