In the last lesson we focused on some basic cleaning operations (subsetting, merging, reshaping, and sumarizing) using base R.  I actually find myself still using these quite a bit.  That being said, I am slowly trying to make the switch to some of the packages that facilitate working with data frames, namely Hadley Wickham's `dplyr` and `reshape`. 

##Quick Links to Exercises and R code
- [Lesson 4 R Code](/gedr/rmd_posts/2015-01-14-04-Clean.R): All the code from this post in an R Script.
- [Exercise 1](#exercise-1): Subsetting the NLA data with `dplyr`
- [Exercise 2](#exercise-2): Merge two NLA data files using `dplyr`
- [Exercise 3](#exercise-3): Using `dplyr` to reshape and modify to get NLA summary stats
- [Exercise 4](#exercise-4): Chain commands together using pipes.

##Lesson Goals
- Better understand data cleaning through use of `dplyr`
- Understand some of the differences between `dplyr` and base R.
- Be able to repeat what we know in base with `dplyr`
- Know what pipes are and why you might want to use them

##What is `dplyr`? 

##Subset

##Exercise 1

##Merging Data

##Exercise 2

##Reshape and Summarize

This is a place where the `reshape` package and the `cast()` function comes in handy.   An example of that might look like:


{% highlight r %}
#Some long from data
long_df<-data.frame(id=c(rep(1,3),rep(2,3),rep(3,3)),
                    variable=rep(c("a","b","c"),3),
                    value=runif(9,1,10))
#cast
reshape::cast(long_df)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##   id        a        b        c
## 1  1 1.502637 4.575337 4.553499
## 2  2 2.104248 2.946282 9.953879
## 3  3 9.128456 3.029909 8.765627
{% endhighlight %}

I will admit that I don't use the `reshape` package a lot, and `melt()` and `cast()` often feel like magic, but they are useful!
