Our next three lessons (Explolre, Analyze, and Visualize) don't actually split neatly into groups.  That being said, I will try my best, but there will be overlap.  For this lesson we are going to focus on some of the first things you do when you start to explore a dataset including basic summary statistics and simple visualizations with base R.

##Quick Links to Exercises and R code
- [Lesson 3 R Code](/gedr/rmd_posts/2015-01-14-05-Explore.R): All the code from this post in an R Script.
- [Exercise 1](#exercise-1): Exploring data with basic summary statistics
- [Exercise 2](#exercise-2): Using base R graphics for exploratory data analysis 

##Lesson Goals
- Be able to calculate a variety of summary statistics
- Continue building familiarity with `dplyr` and base R for summarizing groups
- Create a variety of simple exploratory plots

##Summary Statistics
There are a number of ways to get at the basic summaries of a data frame in R.  The easiest is going to be to use `summary()` which for data frames will return a summary of each column.  For numeric columns it gives quantiles, median, etc. and for factor a frequency of the terms.  Let's go back to iris and take a look.


{% highlight r %}
summary(iris)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##   Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width   
##  Min.   :4.300   Min.   :2.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.100  
##  1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:2.800   1st Qu.:1.600   1st Qu.:0.300  
##  Median :5.800   Median :3.000   Median :4.350   Median :1.300  
##  Mean   :5.843   Mean   :3.057   Mean   :3.758   Mean   :1.199  
##  3rd Qu.:6.400   3rd Qu.:3.300   3rd Qu.:5.100   3rd Qu.:1.800  
##  Max.   :7.900   Max.   :4.400   Max.   :6.900   Max.   :2.500  
##        Species  
##  setosa    :50  
##  versicolor:50  
##  virginica :50  
##                 
##

If you want to look at the range, use `range()`, but it is looking for a vector as input.


{% highlight r %}
range(iris$Petal.Length)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1] 1.0 6.9
{% endhighlight %}

The interquatile range can be easily grabbed with `IQR()`, again a vector is the input.


{% highlight r %}
IQR(iris$Sepal.Width)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1] 0.5
{% endhighlight %}

Lastly, quantiles, at specific points, can be returned with, well, `quantile()`.


{% highlight r %}
quantile(iris$Sepal.Length)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##   0%  25%  50%  75% 100% 
##  4.3  5.1  5.8  6.4  7.9
{% endhighlight %}

I use quantile quite a bit, primarily becuase it provides a bit more flexibility becuase you can specify the probabilities you want to return.


{% highlight r %}
quantile(iris$Sepal.Length, probs=(c(0.025,0.975)))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##   2.5%  97.5% 
## 4.4725 7.7000
{% endhighlight %}
