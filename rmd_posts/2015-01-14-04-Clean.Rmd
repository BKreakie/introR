##Using `dplyr`	to: 

###Subset

###Reshape

This is a place where the `reshape` package and the `cast()` function comes in handy.   An example of that might look like:

```{r cast_longform_examp}
#Some long from data
long_df<-data.frame(id=c(rep(1,3),rep(2,3),rep(3,3)),
                    variable=rep(c("a","b","c"),3),
                    value=runif(9,1,10))
#cast
reshape::cast(long_df)
```

I will admit that I don't use the `reshape` package a lot, and `melt()` and `cast()` often feel like magic, but they are useful!
