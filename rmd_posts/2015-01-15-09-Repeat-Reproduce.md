In theory, you now have a basic understanding of how to conduct a typical data analysis workflow in R.  All that is left is to be able to write it up in such a way that others can not only understand what we did, but repeat it exactly on their own machines. To do this effectively we need to understand how to create reusable R code and create reproducable reports.  This will be a very high level introduction to both concepts, but should hopefully give you a jumping off place for more learning.
